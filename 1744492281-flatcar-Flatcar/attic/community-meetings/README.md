# Old-style community meeting agendas and presentation slides

Community meeting planning / agendas has moved to [Github discussions](../../../../discussions/categories/community-meeting-agenda)

This section in the attic contains agenda markdown files of "old style" Flatcar community calls where the agenda was agreed on in a PR instead of a github discussion.
Also archived here are slide decks used in these meetings.
