    * N: Memzo 
      D: Kinvolk was a valuable source of knowledge when troubleshooting installation issues with our platform vendor. They were able to join us and the vendor on a call and sort out the issues quickly.The use of the Flatcar Update Server gave us confidence about what software/OS versions were running in each of our environments. This allowed us to better test upgrades before promoting the change to production environments.

    * N: Planetary Quantum GmbH
       L: https://www.planetary-quantum.com/
       D: Planetary Quantum is a berlin-based provider of Docker-hosting and application hosting. Our sister company Planetary Networks colocates their private cloud in two (fiber-)interconnected datacenters in Berlin and Quantum offers container-based solutions (Docker Swarm and a custom tailored application hosting) on top of Flatcar Linux. Flatcar Linux is a great choice for us because it's a modern Linux, well-suited for Docker and Kubernetes due to recent versions of Kernel, SystemD, immutable root and a well-tested userland. Simple and straight-forward updates of the OS make running Flatcar a no-brainer for us. We currently operate over 50 clusters for our customers in our private cloud — all based on Flatcar Linux.

    * N: Wipro
      D: Wipro Business Solutions uses Flatcar Linux to power their hybrid/multi-cloud PostgreSQL containerized DBaaS platform. Each provisioned database is running on a dedicated lightweight stack with Flatcar Linux as the foundational OS running on each database VM. In addition the DBaaS API itself and all supporting machines use Flatcar Linux as well. Flatcar Linux has proven to be a well-supported rock solid OS with minimal attack surface, built in update mechanism and integrated docker daemon. Ignition brings in an early boot provisioning utility that perfectly adds to the full automation approach of the PostgreSQL DBaaS platform. We use it at scale on-prem with OpenStack cloud but also with public clouds like Google and Tencent
