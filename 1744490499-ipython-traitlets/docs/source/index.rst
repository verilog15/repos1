Traitlets is a framework that lets Python classes have attributes with type
checking, dynamically calculated default values, and 'on change' callbacks.

The package also includes a mechanism to use traitlets for configuration,
loading values from files or from command line arguments. This is a distinct
layer on top of traitlets, so you can use traitlets in your code without using
the configuration machinery.
