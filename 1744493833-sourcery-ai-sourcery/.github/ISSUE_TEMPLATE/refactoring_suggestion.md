### Checklist

- [ ] I think this refactoring is useful for everyone (if it's too specific, consider a [custom rule](https://docs.sourcery.ai/custom_rules/))
- [ ] I have checked there are no similar [issues](https://github.com/sourcery-ai/sourcery/issues) suggesting the same thing

### Description
<!-- (Explain the refactoring and, if you can, describe how you learned about it.) -->



**Code Before**
<!-- (Give an example of code before refactoring) -->
```python

```

**Code After**
<!-- (Show us what the refactored code looks like) -->
```python

```
