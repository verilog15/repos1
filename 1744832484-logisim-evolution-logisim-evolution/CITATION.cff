  Logisim-evolution is educational software for designing
  and simulating digital logic circuits. Logisim-evolution
  is free, open-source, and cross-platform.


  Project highlights:

  - easy to use circuit designer,

  - logic circuit simulations,

  - chronogram (to see the evolution of signals in your
  circuit),

  - electronic board integration (schematics can be
  simulated on real hardware),

  - VHDL components (components behavior can be specified in
  VHDL!),

  - TCL/TK console (interfaces between the circuit and the
  user),

  - huge library of components (LEDs, TTLs, switches, SoCs),

  - supports multiple languages,

  - and more!
