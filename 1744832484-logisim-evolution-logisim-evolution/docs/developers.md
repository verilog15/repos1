## Requirements ##

`Logisim-evolution` is written in Java 21. To build it from sources you need JDK
(or equivalent, e.g. [OpenJDK](https://adoptopenjdk.net/)) version 21 or newer.

**NOTE:** Ensure your `$JAVA_HOME` environment variable points to the proper JDK version.

## Gradle ##

`Logisim-evolution` uses the [Gradle](https://gradle.org) build system, which means it can be easily imported into modern IDEs
that support it, including [Eclipse](https://www.eclipse.org) and [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/).

## Import project into IDE ##

How to import a Gradle project:

* [How to import Gradle project into Eclipse](https://www.eclipse.org/community/eclipse_newsletter/2018/february/buildship.php),
* [How to import Gradle project into IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/gradle.html) (section "Importing a project
  from a Gradle model").

**Note for Eclipse users:**

To successfully import the project in Eclipse, the complete project structure must be present,
including Java source files built by Gradle.
You can do this by running Gradle task `genFiles` before importing the project.
See [Building from sources](#building-from-sources) for how to run Gradle.

To run the task within Eclipse after importing the Logisim-evolution project:

* Bring up the `Gradle Tasks` view, if it is not already showing, by selecting the menu `Window/Show View/Other...`
  and selecting `Gradle Tasks` under Gradle.
* In the `Gradle Tasks` view, double-click on `logisim-evolution/build/genFiles`.
  Check the `Console View` to see when it finishes.
* Right-click on the Logisim-evolution project in the Project Explorer and select `Gradle/Refresh Gradle Project`.
* You may then need to right-click on the Logisim-evolution project and select `Refresh`.

## Building from sources ##

To build and run the `Logisim-evolution` application, invoke the `Gradle` build system and pass a task name as an argument.
`Logisim-evolution` comes with a Gradle wrapper script, which can be invoked as `./gradlew <ARGS>` on Linux or macOS, and
`gradlew <ARGS>` on Windows.

To build and run on Linux and macOS:

```bash
./gradlew run
```

or on Windows:

```bash
gradlew run
```

If you wish to create a Java JAR package, which can then be run without [Gradle](https://gradle.org), execute:

```bash
./gradlew shadowJar
```

which will create `logisim-evolution-<version>-all.jar` in `build/libs/`.
To run it with JRE/JDK 21 or higher, type:

```bash
java -jar logisim-evolution-<version>-all.jar
```

for example:

```bash
java -jar logisim-evolution-3.6.0-all.jar
```

You can also generate a platform-specific installer, which gets saved in `build/dist`.
Packages can be built by running the `createAll` task:

```bash
./gradlew createAll
```

> **NOTE:** `jpackage` creates the installer for the platform that builds it. Building cross-platform installers is not supported
> by Java's `jpackage` utility. You may also need to install additional developer tools for the platform in order to build the
> installer. See Java's [jpackage documentation](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/21/jpackage/packaging-overview.html)
> for more details of tool requirements.

To see all available tasks run: `./gradlew tasks --all`

## Testing development code ##

`Logisim-evolution` is often updated.
The [branch `main`](https://github.com/logisim-evolution/logisim-evolution/tree/main)
is the place where all the work on next release happens.
Once the code reaches the point it is ready, the next public release will be created from `main`.

If you want to contribute, or even just see what we are currently working on, checkout the `main` branch
and build `Logisim-evolution` from source as described above.

**If you see any issues or have any ideas for improvement, please
[create a ticket](https://github.com/logisim-evolution/logisim-evolution/issues) to make `Logisim-evolution` better!**

## How to contribute ##

If you want to contribute to Logisim-evolution, this is how to do it:

* Make a local *fork* of `Logisim-evolution` by clicking the *Fork* button on the
  [project GitHub page](https://github.com/logisim-evolution/logisim-evolution). This will create
  a copy of the `Logisim-evolution` repository on your own GitHub account.
* As all the development happens on [`main` branch](https://github.com/logisim-evolution/logisim-evolution/tree/main),
  ensure you checkout [`main` branch](https://github.com/logisim-evolution/logisim-evolution/tree/main) before you
  create your own branch.
* Fix the bugs you want to fix on your local fork of the
  [`main` branch](https://github.com/logisim-evolution/logisim-evolution/tree/main).
* Add the features you want to add on your local fork.
* Add/modify the documentation/language support on your local fork.

Once it is running without bugs on your local fork, request a *Pull request* by:

* Go to the *Pull request*-tab and click the button *New pull request*.
* Click on *compare across forks*.
* On the right-hand side select your fork, for example: *head repository: BFH-ktt1/logisim-evolution*
* On the right-hand side select your branch, for example: *base: bugfixes*
* On the left-hand side select the main branch *base: main* (**Important:** All pull requests **MUST**
  be made against [that branch](https://github.com/logisim-evolution/logisim-evolution/tree/main).
* Make sure that there are no conflicts reported.
