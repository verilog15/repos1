C++ API for KeOps
=================

Warning !!
----------

The C++ API of KeOps is available for versions up to 1.5 only. Starting from version 2.0, KeOps uses a meta-programming engine written
in Python to produce C++ or Cuda source code to be further compiled and used through bindings. This section describes the C++ API for
KeOps 1.5, which can be downloaded `here <https://github.com/getkeops/keops/archive/refs/tags/v1.5.zip>`_.


This section documents the use of the KeOps library in C++ codes.
